# Overview
DataHub is a microservice tool enabling developers to rapidly liberate their data.

## Purpose
DataHub addresses the problem of databases having data trapped because they donâ€™t have full API support. Developers provide DataHub with a SQL query and a database connection and it does the heavy lifting of exposing the SQL query as a web service.
