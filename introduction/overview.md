# Overview 
Learn about the DataHub microservice tool for developers

## The Problem
DataHub addresses the problem of databases having data trapped because they don’t have full API support.

## The Solution
DataHub is a microservice tool for developers to rapidly liberate their data.

Developers provide DataHub with a SQL query and a database connection and it does the heavy lifting of exposing the query as a web service. Each developer could code/build this same functionality every time the need arose, but why do the same thing over and over? Instead we built a tool for developers to solve this problem in a reusable way!

::: tip Example use case at Northwestern
The Office of Research’s InfoEd contains research grant application data that other systems at Northwestern, such as the Research Portal, could use if web services were available. InfoEd has limited API support but the data is readily available via SQL queries.
